Currently, professors simply teach students about the shell and assess them with homework, quizzes, and tests. This has proved insufficient to bring the desired proportion of the students up to the required levels of competency. In addition, the lack of diagnostic feedback provided by most shell commands makes self-teaching through experimentation a frustrating experience for the students. ISIS addresses both of these problems and also greatly improves the ability of professors to ascertain which concepts students are struggling with.
